# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

[Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://dubstabber.github.io/Sorting-algorithm-visualizer/) is a simple React app that allows you to see the real-time process of various sorting algorithms. The app visually represents an array of numbers as bars, which change dynamically as sorting takes place.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Cocktail Shaker Sort
- **Real-time Visualization** of the sorting process
- **Interactive UI** with the ability to control array size
- Built using **React** and **Context API** for state management

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dubstabber/Sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage

1. Choose a sorting algorithm from the options.
2. Adjust the array size.
3. Clict the "Generate Sample" to randomize the array of numbers
4. Click the "Sort" button to begin visualization.
5. Watch how the algorithm sorts the bars.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend library
- **Context API** - State management
- **CSS** - Styling and animations
